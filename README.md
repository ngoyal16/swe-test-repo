# swe-test-repo

This repository is designed to provide basic Python examples and solutions to various LeetCode problems. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing Python programming.

## Available Scripts and Directories

- `add_subtract.py`: A simple script that takes two inputs from the user and prints their sum and subtraction.
- `calculator.py`: A basic calculator script for performing arithmetic operations.
- `hello_world.py`: A script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- `reverse_string.py`: A script to reverse a given string input by the user.
- `leetcode-solutions`: A directory containing solutions to specific LeetCode problems.

## LeetCode Solutions

The following is a list of LeetCode problems that have been solved and documented in this repository:

1. `0001. Two Sum` - A solution to the classic problem of finding two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target.
2. `0002. Add Two Numbers` - Solves the problem of adding two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
3. `0003. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters` - Implements an efficient algorithm to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
4. `0004. Median of Two Sorted Arrays` - Finds the median of two sorted arrays, demonstrating an understanding of complex array manipulation.
5. `0005. Longest Palindromic Substring` - A dynamic programming solution to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.
6. `0006. ZigZag Conversion` - The implementation of a function to convert a string to a specific zigzag pattern on a given number of rows.
7. `0007. Reverse Integer` - Provides a method to reverse an integer, considering the handling of overflow.
8. `0008. String to Integer (atoi)` - Implements the atoi function to convert a string to an integer, handling various edge cases.
9. `0009. Palindrome Number` - Determines whether an integer is a palindrome, showcasing a straightforward approach.
10. `0010. Regular Expression Matching` - Explores the implementation of regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*', following specific rules.

## How to Run the Scripts

To run any of the scripts, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, navigate to the script's directory and run the following command:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

Replace `<script_name>` with the name of the script you wish to run.

## Running Tests

To run tests for the scripts, use the following commands:

- `test_add_subtract.py`
- `test_calculator.py`
- `test_reverse_string.py`

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributors are welcome to add new scripts or improve existing ones. Please ensure your contributions are well-documented and follow the project's coding standards.

## Dependencies

The scripts in this repository do not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself.
