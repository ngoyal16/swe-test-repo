## New Script: Addition and Subtraction

This repository now includes a Python script named `add_subtract.py` that takes two inputs from the user and prints their sum and subtraction.

### How to Run the Script

To run the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, navigate to the script's directory and run the following command:

```bash
python add_subtract.py
```

### Example Usage

```bash
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3
The sum of 5 and 3 is 8.
The subtraction of 3 from 5 is 2.
```

This script is straightforward and does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself.
